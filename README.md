- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaDaTha

I am...
I am a lover of IT, tech and science, as well as a developer (fullstack - a bit more backend than frontend) with a good analytic and solution oriented mind.

My strongest skills and how I learned them...
My biggest strength I guess is my quick grasp and my inner fire for IT and technics. Also I am known for my social and communication (soft) skills.

What I am looking for...
I am a "senior but a junior" and looking for a place where I get the chance to evolve and learn a lot while getting the team experience I need to get onto the next level.
I am way more a "jack of all trades" then an "one trick pony" and interested in a lot of different skills, languages and ongoing learning.

One fact (outside of work) about me...
I'm co-founder and co-initiator of "GgKt" (Geschenke gegen Kindertränen / Gifts against children tears) and animal lover.

Additional information
Through familiar circumstances I am looking for a remote position OR a hybrid position with the option in the near future to live/work in Hamburg area / Germany.

- 👀 I’m interested in IT, science in general, animals (especially dogs), making the world a better place ^^

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hopefully many things especially Open Source Projects!

- 📫 How to reach me ... (to be continued)
